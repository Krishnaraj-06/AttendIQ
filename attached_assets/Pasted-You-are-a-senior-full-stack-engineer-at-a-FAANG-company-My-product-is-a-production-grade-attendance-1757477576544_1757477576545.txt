You are a senior full-stack engineer at a FAANG company. My product is a production-grade attendance platform called AttendIQ. Fix my web app code to be FANG-level quality. Currently, the QR code system isn’t working. I need:

QR Code Fix:

Make sure the QR code generated on the Faculty Dashboard correctly encodes session info (class name, session ID, room, timestamp).

When a student scans the QR code, it should automatically take them to a check-in confirmation page (not just random text).

After check-in, mark their attendance in real time in the database and instantly update faculty dashboard.

Eliminate all dummy/fake data and use actual credentials from uploaded Excel sheet.

Local VS Code Setup:

Ensure I can download this project as a ZIP and run it in VS Code with no connection issues.

Include clear setup instructions (env variables, server start commands).

All frontend-backend connections must work seamlessly on localhost.

Mobile Login & Check-In:

Make the login and QR check-in flow work perfectly on mobile.

No broken links or "connection refused" errors.

Optimize responsive design for phones.

Allow students to scan QR from their phone and get instant confirmation.

Production-Grade Standards:

Use a scalable backend (Node.js/Express preferred) and connect it to a persistent database (MongoDB/MySQL/PostgreSQL).

Implement API routes for login, QR generation, check-in, and dashboard updates.

Follow best practices: clean code, error handling, security (JWT/Auth), and proper folder structure.

Code should be FANG-level maintainable and deployment-ready.

End Goal:
I want a polished, enterprise-level attendance system:

Faculty uploads Excel with student credentials.

Students log in, scan QR, and their attendance instantly reflects in the faculty dashboard.

Everything works on Replit, VS Code (local), and mobile devices with no connectivity issues.

Rewrite my code, debug completely, and explain exactly what changes you made, why QR wasn’t working, and how to run it step-by-step locally and on mobile.
