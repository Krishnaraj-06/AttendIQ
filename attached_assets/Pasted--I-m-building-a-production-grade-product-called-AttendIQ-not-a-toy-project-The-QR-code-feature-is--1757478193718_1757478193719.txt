"I’m building a production-grade product called AttendIQ, not a toy project. The QR code feature is currently broken: when I click 'Generate QR Code,' nothing is displayed, and the scan flow is non-functional. I need you to rewrite and debug this entire QR system at FAANG quality:

Fix QR Code Generation:

Ensure clicking Generate QR Code dynamically creates a working QR code that encodes a URL with session details (session ID, class, timestamp).

Fix any canvas rendering issues so the QR visibly shows up every time without refresh.

Implement a proper error handler if QR generation fails.

Fix Scan Flow & Check-In:

When a student scans the QR code, redirect them to a Check-In Confirmation Page that updates their status in the backend.

Student’s attendance must instantly reflect in the faculty dashboard without refresh (real-time updates via WebSocket or polling).

No more dummy data—attendance should use actual student credentials uploaded from an Excel/CSV sheet.

Cross-Platform & Networking:

Make sure the system runs perfectly after I download as ZIP and run locally on VS Code (no connection refused errors).

Fix all localhost vs mobile device issues so students can open this on their phone and scan successfully when server runs locally.

Use ngrok or a secure tunneling setup for testing QR scanning via mobile if needed.

Production-Grade Standards:

Properly structure the code: split frontend (HTML/CSS/JS) and backend (Node.js/Express, database).

Add clear instructions to run locally and deploy in production.

Follow FAANG-level coding practices: error handling, environment variables, CORS handling, and security for QR URLs.

Deliverables:

Fully working code for QR generation, scanning, attendance update.

Clear documentation on what was broken, how it’s fixed, and step-by-step setup to test locally and on mobile devices.

Optimized UI so that clicking Generate QR gives instant, visible feedback (loading spinner, success message).

Goal: This is a real-world SaaS product for smart attendance, not a demo. It must feel enterprise-ready and smooth for judges."*
