- Includes subject, room, expiresAt, and checkInURL in the notification
- Client-side shows notifications and adds QR activities to dashboard
- Face verification uses face-api.js with TinyFaceDetector for performance
- 90% confidence threshold for face matching
- Modular design for easy integration into existing checkin flow
- Final flow: QR Scan → Location Verify → Face Verify → Attendance Marked ✅
